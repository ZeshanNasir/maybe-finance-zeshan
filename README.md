## 🚀 Quick Start (in under 60 seconds)

1. **Upload your data**
    - Use the included `expenses_sample.csv`
    - Or export from your bank:  
      **Your CSV must have these columns in this exact order:**

      ```
      Date,Merchant,Category,Amount
      2025-08-01,Coffee Shop,Fun,5
      2025-08-02,Supermarket,Groceries,45
      2025-08-03,Train Station,Transport,12
      ```

    - **All amounts must be positive** (spending as positive numbers).
    - No “Type” or “Description” columns required.

2. **Install requirements**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (or `pip3` if needed)

3. **Run the ready-made scripts** (Python 3.8+ recommended):

    ```
    python3 analyze_expenses.py        # Pie chart by category
    python3 spending_heatmap.py        # Spending by weekday
    python3 recurring_expenses.py      # Most frequent merchants
    python3 filters_example.py         # Groceries, weekends, or custom filters
    ```

## 🇸🇪 Works With Swedish Banking CSVs

- **CSV column order must be:** `Date,Merchant,Category,Amount`
- Works for real or sample Nordea / Swedbank exports with just those columns.
- ⚠️ **Never upload real bank exports to GitHub — run locally only.**

If you add new columns, just update your scripts to use the new names.
