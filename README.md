## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Upload your data:**
   - Use the included `expenses_sample.csv`
   - Or export your bank/card transactions to a CSV file with **these columns**:
     ```
     Date,Merchant,Category,Amount
     2025-08-01,Coffee Shop,Fun,5
     ```
   - **All amounts must be positive** and represent spending.
   - No "Type" or "Description" columns are required.

2. **Install requirements:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

(or `pip3` if needed)

3. **Run the ready-made scripts (Python 3 recommended):**
(or `pip3` if needed)

python3 analyze_expenses.py # Pie chart by category
python3 spending_heatmap.py # Spending by weekday
python3 recurring_expenses.py # Most frequent merchants
python3 filters_example.py # Groceries, weekends, or custom filters

## 🇸🇪 Works With Swedish Banking CSVs

- **CSV column order must be:**
Date,Merchant,Category,Amount

- Works for real or sample bank exports with just those columns.
- _Never upload private bank files to GitHub—run scripts only on your own computer!_

## 📝 How To Modify For Your CSV

If your export columns are in a different order or have different names:
df = pd.read_csv('yourfile.csv')
df.rename(columns={'OldName':'NewName'}, inplace=True)
If you add new columns, adjust scripts to use the new column names.
