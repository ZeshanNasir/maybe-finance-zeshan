## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Upload your data:**  
   - Use the included `expenses_sample.csv`  
   - Or export your Swedish bank/card transactions to a CSV file with these columns:  
     ```
     Date,Merchant,Category,Amount,Type,Description
     2025-08-01,ICA Maxi,Livsmedel,-450.75,Kortköp,Matinköp för veckan
     ```
   - **Negative amounts** = expenses, **positive** = incomes/savings.

2. **Install all requirements:**  
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the ready-made scripts:**
- `python analyze_expenses.py` – Pie chart by category
- `python spending_heatmap.py` – Heatmap: Spending by weekday
- `python recurring_expenses.py` – Spotting subscriptions/recurring charges
- `python filters_example.py` – Drill-downs: groceries, weekends, and more

## 🇸🇪 Works With Swedish Banking CSVs

- **Column order:** `Date,Merchant,Category,Amount,Type,Description`
- Works with real or sample bank exports.  
- _Never upload private bank files to GitHub—run scripts only on your own computer!_
